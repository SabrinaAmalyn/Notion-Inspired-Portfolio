# Notion-Inspired-Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, designed and developed using HTML & CSS, inspired by Notionâ€™s sleek and organized aesthetic. I built this space to showcase my journey in software development, my projects, and the skills Iâ€™ve gained along the way. The minimalist black-and-white design is intentionalâ€” as I want my projects to take center stage and speak for themselves.

ðŸš§ Work in Progress! ðŸš§

Some image assets are still pending, as I plan to collaborate with my artist friend for custom illustrations. Additionally, the Projects section currently features draft layouts and temporary images sourced from the internet, as I havenâ€™t uploaded all my past work yet. 

Below are the screenshots of each section:
